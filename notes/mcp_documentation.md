# Master Control Program (MCP) Filesystem Documentation

## Overview

The Master Control Program (MCP) is a filesystem management and control system that provides centralized control over file operations, resource allocation, and system access. This document outlines the core components, functionality, and usage of the MCP filesystem.

## Core Components

### 1. File Management System

The MCP file system handles basic operations such as:

- File creation, deletion, and modification
- Directory structure management
- Access control and permissions
- File integrity verification

### 2. Resource Allocation

MCP manages system resources including:

- Memory allocation
- Disk space management
- I/O operations prioritization
- Process scheduling for file operations

### 3. Security Layer

Security features include:

- User authentication and authorization
- Access control lists (ACLs)
- File encryption and decryption
- Audit logging of file operations

## Command Reference

### Basic File Operations

```python
# Import the MCP module
import mcp

# Create a new file
mcp.create_file(path, content, permissions)

# Read file content
content = mcp.read_file(path)

# Update file content
mcp.update_file(path, new_content)

# Delete a file
mcp.delete_file(path)

# List directory contents
files = mcp.list_directory(path)
```

### Access Control

```python
# Set file permissions
mcp.set_permissions(path, user, permissions)

# Check if user has access to a file
has_access = mcp.check_access(path, user, permission_type)

# Add a user to the access control list
mcp.add_user_to_acl(path, user, permissions)

# Remove a user from the access control list
mcp.remove_user_from_acl(path, user)
```

### Resource Management

```python
# Get available disk space
space = mcp.get_available_space()

# Reserve disk space for a file operation
mcp.reserve_space(size)

# Release reserved space
mcp.release_space(reservation_id)

# Set file operation priority
mcp.set_priority(operation_id, priority_level)
```

## Configuration

The MCP filesystem can be configured through the `mcp_config.yaml` file:

```yaml
filesystem:
  root_directory: "/mcp/root"
  max_file_size: 1073741824 # 1GB
  supported_formats: ["txt", "doc", "pdf", "jpg", "png"]

security:
  encryption_algorithm: "AES-256"
  password_policy: "strong"
  session_timeout: 3600 # seconds

resources:
  max_memory_allocation: 4294967296 # 4GB
  disk_quota_per_user: 10737418240 # 10GB
  max_concurrent_operations: 100
```

## Implementation Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**

   - Always check return values from MCP operations
   - Implement proper exception handling for MCP errors
   - Use the `mcp.get_last_error()` function to retrieve detailed error information

2. **Performance Optimization**

   - Use batch operations when processing multiple files
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed files
   - Utilize the `mcp.optimize()` function periodically

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Regularly update MCP to the latest version
   - Implement principle of least privilege for file access
   - Enable audit logging in production environments

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

| Issue                   | Possible Cause             | Solution                                                 |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Access Denied" error   | Insufficient permissions   | Check user permissions and ACLs                          |
| Slow file operations    | Resource contention        | Adjust priority levels or schedule during off-peak hours |
| Corruption during write | Disk failure or power loss | Enable journaling and use `mcp.verify_integrity()`       |
| Out of space error      | Disk quota exceeded        | Use `mcp.cleanup_unused()` or request quota increase     |
